## Reflection Document

### HTML

- I used the videos for help
- I found the exercises in this section very helpful. I liked the repetitive tasks because they helped enforce some of the concepts, as well as learning about the shortcuts such as "input:text". I found the first exercisethe most helpful since it was easy and made the rest more encouraging to do.
- Something that I wish had been explained better was how the Mr Krabs emails were separated because I did not understand how the second email was still associated with "Mr Krabs" name even when we made a new row for that email.
- I can't think of any other exercises that might have helped me learn this weekâ€™s topic a little better?

### Accessibility

- I was able to complete the exercises on my own.
- I liked this practice and found it helpful. I referenced HW1 to help answer the questions here.
- The concepts for this practice were covered well in class.

### CSS

- I used the videos to complete the exercises
- I found the exercises fun, and the videos helped explain the info well
- selector specificty was a little confusing

### flexbox , css-grid, bootstrap

- I used the videos to complete the exercises
- There were lots of exercises so I appreciated the in depth tutorial in the playlists 
- I think everythig was explained well, and can't think of another practice to explain it better
